Linux file commands simulation in C.

- Implemented in C with linked lists;
- Simulates commands such as : ls, touch, mkdir, rmdir, rm, cd, etc.;
- Infinite loop until stop command is received;
- The difficult part of this project was the memory management, 
freeing every allocated memory and being careful with the pointers of the linked lists;
